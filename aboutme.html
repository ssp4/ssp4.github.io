            Senior at the University of Florida studying        Telecommunication with a focus in Media in Society

            Minor: International Development and Humanitarian Assistance 

This website is a personal look at my professional career. I have had a lot of work experience for someone my age and use that to look at the world from a career driven point of view. My first job was working for Goodwill Industries and by the time I was sixteen I was hired as an assistant manager. I then moved to Gainesville, Florida to pursue a degree and was working at the Lawrence W. Tyree Library on Santa Feâ€™s campus as a circulation assistant. After acquiring my associates I decided to take a year off to teach at a Montessori School. Once I received the news of entry into the University of Florida I realized I needed to pursue school full time. I am now studying Telecommunications with a focus in Media and Society and a minor in International Assistance and Humanitarian Development. I am hoping to work in a non-profit environment once I graduate and work my way into a field that uses social media as a platform to bring awareness to problems that arise around the world.
